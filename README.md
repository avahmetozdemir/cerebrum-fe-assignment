# Cerebrum Front End Assignment

An application that aims to have similiar functionalities with Schiphol Airport web sites arrivals and departures flight information. Used Schiphol public api to fetch flights according to our desires. To get data from this api first we need to create a proxy to handle of their cors policy error. To reach that middleware, you can clone my middleware-for-cors-error repository from my github profile. All you need to do is to start that middleware on http://localhost:5000/.
